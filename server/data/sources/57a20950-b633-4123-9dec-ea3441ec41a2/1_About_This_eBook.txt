About This eBook
ePUB is an open, industry-standard format for eBooks.
However, support of ePUB and its many features varies
across reading devices and applications. Use your device
or app settings to customize the presentation to your
liking. Settings that you can customize often include font,
font size, single or double column, landscape or portrait
mode, and figures that you can click or tap to enlarge.
For additional information about the settings and
features on your reading device or app, visit the device
manufacturer’s Web site.
Many titles include programming code or configuration
examples. To optimize the presentation of these
elements, view the eBook in single-column, landscape
mode and adjust the font size to the smallest setting. In
addition to presenting code and configurations in the
reflowable text format, we have included images of the
code that mimic the presentation found in the print
book; therefore, where the reflowable format may
compromise the presentation of the code listing, you will
see a “Click here to view code image” link. Click the link
to view the print-fidelity code image. To return to the
previous page viewed, click the Back button on your
device or app.

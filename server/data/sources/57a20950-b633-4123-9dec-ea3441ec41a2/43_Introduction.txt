Introduction
Welcome to CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Cram,
sixth edition. This book helps you get ready to take and
pass the CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 exam.
This book is designed to remind you of everything you
need to know to pass the SY0-601 certification exam.
Each chapter includes a number of practice questions
that should give you a reasonably accurate assessment of
your knowledge, and, yes, we’ve provided the answers
and their explanations for these questions. Read this
book, understand the material, and you’ll stand a very
good chance of passing the real test.
Exam Cram books help you understand and appreciate
the subjects and materials you need to know to pass
CompTIA certification exams. Exam Cram books are
aimed strictly at test preparation and review. They do not
teach you everything you need to know about a subject.
Instead, the authors streamline and highlight the
pertinent information by presenting and dissecting the
questions and problems they’ve discovered that you’re
likely to encounter on a CompTIA test.
We strongly recommend that you spend some time
installing and working with security tools such as
Wireshark and Metasploit and experimenting with the
many network and security-related resources provided
with many operating systems. The Security+ exam
focuses on such activities and the knowledge and skills
they can provide you. Nothing beats hands-on
experience and familiarity when it comes to
understanding the questions you’re likely to encounter
on a certification test. Book learning is essential, but
®

without a doubt, hands-on experience is the best teacher
of all!
Let’s begin by looking at preparation for the exam.
HOW TO PREPARE FOR THE EXAM
This text follows the official exam objectives closely to
help ensure your success. The CompTIA exam covers 5
domains and 35 objectives. This book is divided into 5
parts and 35 chapters, aligning with those domains and
objectives. These official objectives from CompTIA can
be found here:
https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/exam-
objectives.
As you examine the numerous exam topics now covered
in Security+, resist the urge to panic! This book you are
holding will provide you with the knowledge (and
confidence) that you need to succeed. You just need to
make sure you read it and follow the guidance it provides
throughout your Security+ journey.
Practice Tests
This book is filled with practice exam questions to get
you ready! Cram quizzes end each chapter, and each
question also includes complete explanations.
In addition, the book includes two additional full
practice tests in the Pearson Test Prep software, available
to you either online or as an offline Windows application.
To access the practice exams, please see the instructions
in the card inserted in the sleeve in the back of the book.
This card includes a unique access code that enables you
to activate your exams in the Pearson Test Prep software.
In case you are interested in more practice exams than
are provided with this book, Pearson IT Certification
publishes a Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test

product. In addition to providing you with three eBook
files (EPUB, PDF, and Kindle) this product provides you
with two additional exams’ worth of questions. The
Premium Edition version also offers you a link to the
specific section in the book that presents an overview of
the topic covered in the question, allowing you to easily
refresh your knowledge. The insert card in the back of
the book includes a special offer for an 80% discount off
of this Premium Edition eBook and Practice Test
product, which is an incredible deal.
TAKING A CERTIFICATION EXAM
After you prepare for your exam, you need to register
with a testing center. At the time of this writing, the cost
to take the Security+ exam is US $349 for individuals.
Students in the United States are eligible for a significant
discount. In addition, check with your employer as many
workplaces provide reimbursement programs for
certification exams. For more information about these
discounts, you can contact a local CompTIA sales
representative, who can answer any questions you might
have. If you don’t pass, you can take the exam again for
the same cost as the first attempt until you pass. The test
is administered by Pearson VUE testing centers, with
locations globally. In addition, the CompTIA Security+
certification is a requirement for many within the U.S.
military, and testing centers are available on some
military bases.
You will have 90 minutes to complete the exam. The
exam consists of a maximum of 90 questions. If you have
prepared, you should find that this is plenty of time to
properly pace yourself and review the exam before
submission.
Arriving at the Exam Location

As with any other examination, arrive at the testing
center early (at least 15 minutes). Be prepared! You need
to bring two forms of identification (one with a picture).
The testing center staff requires proof that you are who
you say you are and that someone else is not taking the
test for you. Arrive early because if you are late, you will
be barred from entry and will not receive a refund for the
cost of the exam.
ExamAlert
You’ll be spending a lot of time in the exam room.
Plan on using the full 90 minutes allotted for your
exam and surveys. Policies differ from location to
location regarding bathroom breaks, so check with
the testing center before beginning the exam.
In the Testing Center
You will not be allowed to take into the examination
room study materials or anything else that could raise
suspicion that you’re cheating. This includes practice test
material, books, exam prep guides, and other test aids.
The testing center will provide you with scratch paper
and a pen or pencil. These days, this often comes in the
form of an erasable whiteboard.
Examination results are available immediately after you
finish the exam. After submitting the exam, you will be
notified if you have passed or failed. I trust that if you are
reading this book, you will pass. The test administrator
will also provide you with a printout of your results.
ABOUT THIS BOOK
The ideal reader for an Exam Cram book is someone
seeking certification. However, it should be noted that an
Exam Cram book is a very easily readable, rapid

presentation of facts. Therefore, an Exam Cram book is
also extremely useful as a quick reference manual.
The book is designed so that you can either read it cover
to cover or jump across chapters, as needed. Because the
book chapters align with the exam objectives, some
chapters may have slight overlap on topics. Where
required, references to the other chapters are provided
for you. If you need to brush up on a topic or if you have
to bone up for a second try at the exam, you can use the
index, table of contents, or Table I.1 to go straight to the
topics and questions that you need to study. Beyond
helping you prepare for the test, we think you’ll find this
book useful as a tightly focused reference on some of the
most important aspects of the Security+ certification.

This book includes other helpful elements in addition to
the actual logical, step-by-step learning progression of
the chapters. Exam Cram books use elements such as
ExamAlerts, notes, and practice questions to make
information easier to read and absorb. This text also
includes a Glossary to assist you.
Note
Reading this book from start to finish is not
necessary; this book is set up so that you can quickly
jump back and forth to find sections you need to
study.
Use the Cram Sheet to remember last-minute facts
immediately before the exam. Use the practice questions
to test your knowledge. You can always brush up on
specific topics in detail by referring to the table of
contents and the index. Even after you achieve
certification, you can use this book as a rapid-access
reference manual.

Exam Objectives
Table I.1 lists the skills the SY0-601 exam measures and
the chapter in which each objective is discussed.
The Chapter Elements
Each Exam Cram book has chapters that follow a
predefined structure. This structure makes Exam Cram
books easy to read and provides a familiar format for all
Exam Cram books. The following elements typically are
used:
▶ Chapter topics
▶ Essential Terms and Components
▶ Cram Quizzes
▶ ExamAlerts
▶ Notes
▶ Available exam preparation software practice questions and answers
Note
Bulleted lists, numbered lists, tables, and graphics are
also used where appropriate. A picture can paint a
thousand words sometimes, and tables can help to
associate different elements with each other visually.
Now let’s look at each of the elements in detail:
▶ Chapter topics: Each chapter contains details of all subject matter
listed in the table of contents for that particular chapter. The objective of
an Exam Cram book is to cover all the important facts without giving
too much detail. When examples are required, they are included.
▶ Essential Terms and Components: The start of every chapter
contains a list of terms and concepts you should understand. These are
all defined in the book’s accompanying Glossary.
▶ Cram Quizzes: Each chapter concludes with multiple-choice
questions to help ensure that you have gained familiarity with the
chapter content.
▶ ExamAlerts: ExamAlerts address exam-specific, exam-related
information. An ExamAlert addresses content that is particularly
important, tricky, or likely to appear on the exam. An ExamAlert looks
like this:

ExamAlert
Make sure you remember the different ways in
which you can access a router remotely. Know which
methods are secure and which are not.
▶ Notes: Notes typically contain useful information that is not directly
related to the topic currently under consideration. To avoid breaking up
the flow of the text, they are set off from the regular text.
Note
This is a note. You have already seen several notes.
Other Book Elements
Most of this Exam Cram book on Security+ follows the
consistent chapter structure already described. However,
there are various important elements that are not part of
the standard chapter format. These elements apply to the
entire book as a whole.
▶ Practice questions: Exam-preparation questions conclude each
chapter.
▶ Answers and explanations for practice questions: These follow
each practice question, providing answers and explanations to the
questions.
▶ Glossary: The Glossary defines important terms used in this book.
▶ Cram Sheet: The Cram Sheet is a quick-reference, tear-out cardboard
sheet of important facts that is useful for last-minute preparation. The
Cram Sheet provides a simple summary of the facts that may be most
difficult to remember.
▶ Companion website: The companion website for your book allows
you to access several digital assets that come with your book, including
the following:
▶ Pearson Test Prep software (both online and Windows desktop
versions)
▶ Key Terms Flash Cards application
▶ A PDF version of the Cram Sheet

Customizing Your Exams
In the exam settings screen, you can choose to take
exams in one of three modes:

▶ Study Mode
▶ Practice Exam Mode
▶ Flash Card Mode
Study Mode allows you to fully customize your exams
and review answers as you are taking the exam. This is
typically the mode you use first to assess your knowledge
and identify information gaps. Practice Exam Mode locks
certain customization options, as it presents a realistic
exam experience. Use this mode when you are preparing
to test your exam readiness. Flash Card Mode strips out
the answers and presents you with only the question
stem. This mode is great for late-stage preparation, when
you really want to challenge yourself to provide answers
without the benefit of seeing multiple-choice options.
This mode will not provide the detailed score reports that
the other two modes will, so it should not be used if you
are trying to identify knowledge gaps.
In addition to these three modes, you can select the
source of your questions. You can choose to take exams
that cover all of the chapters, or you can narrow your
selection to just a single chapter or the chapters that
make up specific parts in the book. All chapters are
selected by default. If you want to narrow your focus to
individual chapters, simply deselect all the chapters and
then select only those on which you wish to focus in the
Objectives area.
You can also select the exam banks on which to focus.
Each exam bank comes complete with a full exam of
questions that cover topics in every chapter. The two
Practice Exams printed in the book are available to you,
as are two additional exams of unique questions. You can
have the test engine serve up exams from all four banks
or just from one individual bank by selecting the desired
banks in the exam bank area.
There are several other customizations you can make to
your exam from the exam settings screen, such as the

time you are allowed for taking the exam, the number of
questions served up, whether to randomize questions
and answers, whether to show the number of correct
answers for multiple-answer questions, or whether to
serve up only specific types of questions. You can also
create custom test banks by selecting only questions that
you have marked or questions on which you have added
notes.
Updating Your Exams
If you are using the online version of the Pearson Test
Prep software, you should always have access to the
latest version of the software as well as the exam data. If
you are using the Windows desktop version, every time
you launch the software, it will check to see if there are
any updates to your exam data and automatically
download any changes that were made since the last time
you used the software. You must be connected to the
Internet at the time you launch the software.
Sometimes, due to many factors, the exam data may not
fully download when you activate an exam. If you find
that figures or exhibits are missing, you may need to
manually update your exams. To update a particular
exam you have already activated and downloaded,
simply select the Tools tab and click the Update
Products button. Again, this is only an issue with the
desktop Windows application.
If you wish to check for updates to the Pearson Test Prep
exam engine software, Windows desktop version, simply
select the Tools tab and click the Update Application
button. This will ensure you are running the latest
version of the software engine.
CONTACTING THE AUTHOR

Hopefully, this book provides you with the tools you
need to pass the Security+ exam. Feedback is
appreciated. You can follow and contact the author on
Twitter @martyweiss.
Thank you for selecting my book; I have worked to apply
the same concepts in this book that I have used in the
hundreds of training classes I have taught. Spend your
study time wisely and you, too, can achieve the Security+
designation. Good luck on the exam, although if you
carefully work through this text, you will certainly
minimize the amount of luck required!

Part I
Attacks, Threats, and
Vulnerabilities
This part covers the following official
Security+ SYO-601 exam objectives for
Domain 1.0, “Attacks, Threats, and
Vulnerabilities”:
▶ 1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering
techniques.
▶ 1.2 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the
type of attack.
▶ 1.3 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with
application attacks.
▶ 1.4 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with
network attacks.
▶ 1.5 Explain different threat actors, vectors, and intelligence sources.
▶ 1.6 Explain the security concerns associated with various types of
vulnerabilities.
▶ 1.7 Summarize the techniques used in security assessments.
▶ 1.8 Explain the techniques used in penetration testing.
For more information on the official CompTIA Security+
SY0-601 exam topics, see the section “Exam Objectives”
in the Introduction.
The requirement to adequately assess the security
posture of an enterprise environment and to be able to
recommend and implement appropriate security
solutions involves many complexities and requirements.
Today’s networks and computer systems are complex
and distributed across varying environments. To be able
to assess these environments and make the best
decisions about securing them, you must understand the

risk associated with them—including attacks, threats,
and vulnerabilities across the technology landscape. The
chapters in this part of the book explore the many
potential threats, the varying attack types, and
vulnerabilities to help you understand and identify these
potential dangers, as well as important measures and
processes that can assist in managing the risk.

Social engineering has been around as long as humans.
Many people are familiar with face-to-face interactions
in which one individual fishes for information in a
deceptive way. Social engineering is the process by which
an attacker seeks to extract useful information from
users, often by just tricking them into helping the
attacker. In many circumstances, social engineering is
the precursor to more advanced attacks. Social
engineering is extremely successful because it relies on
human emotions. Common examples include the
following:
▶ An attacker calls a valid user and impersonates a guest, temp agent, or
new user, asking for assistance in accessing the network or requesting
details on the business processes of the organization.
▶ An attacker contacts a legitimate user and poses as a technical aide,
attempting to update some type of information. The attacker asks for
identifying user details that can then be used to gain access.
▶ An attacker poses as a network administrator, directing the legitimate
user to reset the password to a specific value so t
